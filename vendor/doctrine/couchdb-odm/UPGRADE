Upgrade from Alpha2 to Alpha3
=============================

Fixed inconsistencies with Mapped Superclasses
----------------------------------------------

There have been quite some bugs with mapped superclass handlings in the course of the Alpha3.
They are now fixed to have the same semantical apperance as in the other Doctrine mappers.
In the course of this there might be changes that break backwards compatibility.

Changed Annotation Indexing notation
------------------------------------

The notation to index a class or property as searchable through a repository using a CouchDB
view has changed from:

    /** @Document(indexed=true) */
    class User
    {
        /** @Field(indexed=true) */
        private $username;
    }

to:

    /** @Document @Index */
    class User
    {
        /** @Field @Index */
        private $username;
    }

Changed XML and YAML Indexing Attribute
---------------------------------------

The attribute for indexing classes or properties in XML and YAML was renamed from "indexed" to "index".

Upgrade from Alpha 1 to Alpha2
==============================

Metadata Document representation changed
----------------------------------------

The Metadata representation of Doctrine mapped CouchDB documents changed significantly.
To migrate your old data you have to call:

    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:migrate "Doctrine\ODM\CouchDB\Tools\Migrations\Alpha2Migration"

To make this work you have to put your own doctrine-couchdb.php in your project. You can copy
it from bin/ or sandbox/ folders of the CouchDB migration. Make sure to also ship a cli-config.php
script like shown in the sandbox/cli-config.php

To migrate your doctrine associations and repositories, call:

    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:odm:update-design-doc doctrine_associations
    php doctrine-couchdb.php couchdb:odm:update-design-doc doctrine_repositories
